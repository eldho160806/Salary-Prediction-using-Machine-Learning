# Salary-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
💼 Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning  This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict whether an individual's income is greater than $50K per year using demographic and work-related features from the UCI Adult Income Dataset.

🎯 Goal:
Classify salary category (>50K or <=50K) using supervised learning models, with an emphasis on model accuracy, handling class imbalance, and explainability.

🚀 Project Highlights:
   -🔍 Dataset: UCI Adult Income Dataset (cleaned and preprocessed)
   -⚙️ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   -🧠 Model Used: RandomForestClassifier
   -📊 Model Accuracy: 85.9%
   -🧪 Includes preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation (classification report & confusion matrix)

📂 What's Included:
  -✅ salary_prediction.ipynb – Google Colab compatible notebook
  -📄 adult 3.csv – Cleaned dataset (if publicly shareable)
  -📈 Final_Salary_Prediction_Project.pptx – Presentation-ready PPT
  -📘 README.md – Project overview and usage instructions

📌 Use Cases:
 This type of predictive modeling can be useful for:
    *HR analytics and recruitment 
    *Income classification for financial eligibility
    *Demographic studies and research
