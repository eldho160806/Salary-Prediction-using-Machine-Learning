# Salary-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

💼 Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning  This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict whether an individual's income is greater than $50K per year using demographic and work-related features from the UCI Adult Income Dataset.

🎯 **Goal:**
Classify salary category (>50K or <=50K) using supervised learning models, with an emphasis on model accuracy, handling class imbalance, and explainability.
**
